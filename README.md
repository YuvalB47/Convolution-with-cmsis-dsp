# Convolution-with-cmsis-dsp

Designed for an STM32L476 microcontroller and includes convolution function. 
The code is primarily focused on measuring and comparing the execution time of a custom convolution function and the CMSIS-DSP library function. 
The results are printed to the console via UART.
